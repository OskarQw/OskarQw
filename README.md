## oskar

my name is oskar <br>
i'm a young developer in college <br>
computing is my passion and has been all my life

i mainly use **python and c#** but i'm aiming to learn more, mainly java and js

my pronouns are he/him<br>
[you can read all of my pronoun preferences here](https://en.pronouns.page/@oskarq)<br>
[and my polish pronoun preferences here](https://zaimki.pl/@oskarq)<br>

i'm a male in england, and a polish and british citizen

i like software, networks and data 

everything here is currently passion projects, and likely private most of the time<br>
if you're here for any of my mcsr stuff i said might be here (rng seedfinder, state tracker, queue list etc) it's likely that i set it to private, send me a message
